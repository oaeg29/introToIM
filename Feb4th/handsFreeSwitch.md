**Here is the description of my hands free switch**

For my Handless Switch assignment I decided to create a switch that operates when you touch it with your tongue/when you lick it, knowing that human saliva is a conductor of electricity. I re-used a plastic cup from the universityâ€™s coffee shop to mount a bottle cap in which two wires meet. These two wires, when connected, allow the current to move outside of the circuit into the ground port on the Red Board.
